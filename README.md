# About
Simple math/algorithm program written in Go! The math functions are using linear algebra and Geometry concepts (Plane, Vector3, Triangle). When I created this project, I wanted to see what these core math functions would look like in Go instead of C++/C# (where I've implemented that previous).

# How to run
Make sure [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) is installed. From command line just type:
```
go run .
```

# How to run the tests
